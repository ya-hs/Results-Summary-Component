## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma


### What I learned

I used this challenge as an opportunity to begin my journey in learning to use Figma. Rather than subscribing to Pro to unlock the figma files, I recreated the component from scratch to the best of my abilities. Once I was happy with how it looked in figma, I used the developer mode to pull across measurements.

I learned that working in this way, whilst useful for comparison, is not perfect. Hard-coded pixel sizes for widths and heights can cause making the site responsive to be quite difficult. As such, I only coded the responsiveness to work for the suggested 375x809px mobile display without any other mobile resolutions in mind.

In future I would like to look at using ems, rems, and percentages along with figma to try and keep it as responsive as possible.



### Continued development

As mentioned, I will use this opportunity to continue learning how Figma works and how to go back to percentages for responsiveness.
